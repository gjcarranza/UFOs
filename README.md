# UFOs
In a town filled to the brim with UFO sightings, my client wanted an html page containing information about UFO sightings in every country, city, and type of sighting with given data the client has presented.

# Results

The user can navigate through the page by reloading the page by clicking the navbar (circled in red) at the top right corner and can filter their desired date, city, state, country, and shape where a list of the desired data is formulated on the right side of the screen. Desired parameters are not limited to being entered one at a time, and can initialized simultaneously to retrieve the desired data

# Summary

A drawback of this webpage is its limited quantity of data points. Essentially the user would have to be aware of the existence of the raw data file in order to understand that the data is limited to being only within the country, USA. An improvement that may prove beneficial to the webpage is to provide the capability of anonymous users to post sightings to increase the webpage's credibility. Another possibility is scraping from other websites with already-large-enough dataset to compile a more dynamic webpage to the user. Perhaps providing a gallery section of pictures that were photographed by generous users who have reported and documented a UFO sighting. It is also noted that prior to initializing a filtered search, all of the data is displayed nearing the bottom of the webpage. A suggestion would be to minimize the amount visible to provide a more seemless experience to the user.

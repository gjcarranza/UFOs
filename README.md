# UFOs
In a town filled to the brim with UFO sightings, my client wanted an html page containing information about UFO sightings in every country, city, and type of sighting with given data the client has presented.

# Results

Ideally, the user can navigate through the page by reloading the page by clicking the navbar at the top right corner and can filter their desired date, city, state, country, and shape where a list of the desired data is formulated on the right side of the screen. Desired parameters are not limited to being entered one at a time, and can initialized simultaneously to retrieve the desired data

# Summary

A drawback of this webpage is its limited quantity of data points. Essentially the user would have to be aware of the existence of the raw data file in order to understand that the data is limited to being only within the country, USA. An improvement that may prove beneficial to the webpage is to provide the capability of anonymous users to post sightings to increase the webpage's credibility. Another possibility is scraping from other websites with already-large-enough dataset to compile a more dynamic webpage to the user. Perhaps providing a gallery section of pictures that were photographed by generous users who have reported and documented a UFO sighting

An issue arose while running the files as the error reads as "crbug/1173575, non-JS module files deprecated." By cross referencing through other sources, it seems that there is no tangible solution as this seems to be an issue with Chrome itself. The hope lies that when the file is run by an outside source, the webpage can load properly.
